# Pocedural-Mesh-Generation
Mesh Generation using Perlin Noise in Unity

This scripts will make an infinite landscape for the player. The far meshes will disappear when the player goes far away from it. There will be 9 meshes around the player. The near 5 mesh will have high details and the far 4 meshes will have low detail to optimize the process.

The mesh are made by creating a 2D mesh of Perlin Noise and then giving it a colormap according to the height of the perlin noise.
